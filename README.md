# Nutritionz-Compatplus-Delights

This datapack adds NutritionZ compatibility for a variety of “Delight” food mods, giving all their custom food items balanced nutrient values in line with the base mod’s system.

Each food item has been individually assigned values for the nutrients:
- Carbohydrates
- Protein
- Fat
- Vitamins
- Minerals

The goal is to keep things immersive and balanced - foods from Delight mods now properly contribute to your nutrition status, unlocking the full potential of the NutritionZ experience with both positive and negative effects.

Important note:
This is a datapack only. Make sure NutritionZ is installed to make use of this pack. Also NutritionZ is the orgininal mod, this datapack only uses the code to add more compatibility for other delight mods.

Future:
I'm working on compatibility with Create:food and some other delight mods.
